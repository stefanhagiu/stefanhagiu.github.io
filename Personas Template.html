				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Every day Stefan interacts with code, through IDE's or white boards or pen and paper. He has already established a process of
					writing each feature he will deliver for the customers. Each time he has a small session of looking up in the existing code,
					he says this is a must in order to understand the current state and logic of the code, where he wants, needs, to implement the 
					new functionality. After that he will write a small flow diagram to check what components are need it and how the "data" flows.
					Then he writes the code and after all is done he tests. 
				</p>
				<p>All that process dose not guarantee success but, Stefan says, it increases the chances of not having bugs in the code. If there are bugs
					he will have to manualy check each state of code to see what happens (most of the times this is done mentally).
				</p>
				<p>He enjoys trying to write in different paradigmes, if the code is more data diven he will write it functionaly, if the functionality is simple
					and the code needs to be delivered fast or is a prototype most of the time procedural will be the way to go. To add structure to data OOP is 
					the way to go. He also likes to toy with should i use "composition or inheritance".
				</p>
				<p>Stefan said he has multiple accounts to sites like FrontendMasters and Brilliant or Egghead. He says that is the only way he can keep up with the 
					changes in his field. At the same time he feels that most of the changes that come are just "more of the same with small nuances".

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>A day in Iulia life is like a sprint with obstacles, a sprint within a maraton (1 year cycle) in which she has to deliver the condensed curriculum
				while keeping the students intrested and answering all the question that are throw her way. Her students are very different in the way they understand 
				the content so it's always challenging  to try and fit the content such that everyone understands.</p>
				<p>Over the years she has found out that having more then one way to solve a problem and to represent it is the best way to go in teaching it to the kids.
					For example in order to solve recursion they use a state table where each state of the recursion is marked and removed once the cycle is done. Or for
					representing the swapping between 2 values they use actual objects like 3 cans and so own.
				</p>
				<p>She says she always looks to teach the students to experimet, "they need to have a flexible and agile mind and I have to come up with ways to help them".
					In previous years she added, even if it's not in the curriculum C# and F# and they proved to be really fun and intriguing for the students and herself.
					"The fact that they were able to visualise what they build. Not just some text on the screen but buttons and icons and such made the students really happy".
					And the intresting part is that Iulia didn't had any prior knowlged of C# or F# but she did it for her students.
				</p>
				<p>Even if C# and F# had some good results they are close to C languages and now she hopes she can find something different to continue her experiment.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="personaScenarios">
			<h5>Scenarios - with bullet points</h5>
			<p>• have the students play with a new language and try to solve a simple problem that they already solved in C</p>
			<p>• when explaining a new problem to use the application to showcase the stages of the algorithm</p>
			<p>• fun is the best way to learn - have all the group explore a new way of "writing" code (PIET)</p>

					<h5>Main Points</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>I solve all of my customers problem using well refined and tested patterns.</li>
						<li>Most of the problems out there have been solved and that is why we have programming patterns</li>
						<li>The world is a hierarchy of classes, we should model programs as such</li>
						<li>Writing a program is like building a puzzle to fit the problem you are trying to solve</li>
						<li>Raw data should be model into the code and not the other way arownd.</li>
						<li>I like to read about new trends in programming, but from my experience they all die because they solve already solved problems</li>

					<h5>Goals</h5>
					<p>Goals are the reasons users perform tasks, not the tasks.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Write the best product that I can for my customers.</li>

						<li>Imbue my junior with good, healthy programming habits.</li>
					</ul>
				</div>
				<div class="leftGroup">
					<h5>Frustrations and Pain Points</h5>
					<p>Some of the difficulties the user has with the product.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>It annoys me when I have to write interfaces, there are so many frameworks and they don't even solve the problems proprely.</li>
						<li>The fact that the Web works as it does it's a miracle and a curse - it's like an ongoing experiment with no though for sustainability & maintainability</li>
						<li>I can't get the people which try to model the world for what it's not. A action is a series of procedures but the action is made by something and it is apply to/by an object</li>
						<li>Well written code is hard to come by this days</li>

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Bogdan day starts usualy by reading his email, and answering to most urgent issues. Then he check with the project owner to see if the priorities are still the same. He then
					moves on to his assigned tasks. To solve this he consults with the business analyst, in order to have a good grasp on the subject, "this helps me to make design decisions
					that will help further down the line". On his desk you can find 2 books, one is Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software and Introduction to Algorithms (MIT Press).
					He said he read them multiple times over the time of his career and it always helped him when he head to solve a though problem.
				</p>
				<p>
					As my career progressed I've always tryed to help my peers to better understand how to structure the code in a natural way. "For me this always came easy, and so I want to share
					my knowlged in the hopes that it will help my peers write better code, and in doing so having a better product". When he was younger Bogdan experimented with multiple paradigmes of
					writing code, but as his senior, back then, advised him," I came to see that modeling the world should be in a 1 to 1 relation with the code it's only natural that we think in objects".
					Paradigmes like Functional programming or Procedural or Logic are not natural, in his opinion, "They are intresting and a real brain workout but they don't solve with grace real world problems".
				</p>
				<p> As a professional Bogdan alawyas tries to stay on top of things so he reads about the advances in industry, any new book or accredited (form well established entities) workshop is wellcome. "I have 
					to keep up with the changes in order to better solve the tasks that come my way. It is funny how ever how hard is to find something trully new - the older I get the harder is to not find patterns when
					a new 'technology', somehow I can see the shorcomes almost immediately. I'm not going to say OOP is purfect but it's the best thing we have at the moment that is why I'm still looking".

				<h5>Detailed Description</h5>
				<p>Iulia is a student at High School Grigore Moisil, as such her schedule is from 8 to 13 each day, 5 days a week. She enjoys the practical side
					of things, she likes anything that has to do with actual real life experimentation. In her own words "if it's visual then I can reason about it".
				</p>
				<p>One of the best places, she says, is the High School lab of Informatics. Her teacher has an unusal way of teaching the curriculum, he uses real life objects,
					like small cubs of different sizes and colors and applys most of the algorithms. Most of the curriculum materials will be created by the students, and that 
					is the part Iulia likes the most. "It's the fact that you can see how and where each pice goes - you don't have to keep that in your head, we even creat shapes 
					and arrows to draw logical diagrams".
				</p>
				<p>
					She likes to apply the things she learns in the informatic class in other class also, it can help her to understand better the subject. It also helped her solve
					problems she though she had no idead how to solve, because it gave her courage to try new ways of solving the issue without thinking that she "might fail". "It is
					really hard to explain the feeling of joy when you solve a problem that you had no idea how to approach initially".
