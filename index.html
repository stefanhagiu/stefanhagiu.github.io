            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                EsoX (Esoteric Language User Experience), is a project that is meant to imagine various user experiences regarding multiple ways of 
                interaction with an esoteric programming language, plus activities of  (e.g., learning, programming, translating into a general purpose 
                language, research,...) and related tools like interpreters, compilers, development environments, notable applications, and others. 
                The developed application will also recommend other (esoteric) programming languages according to user preferences, language categories 
                (paradigm, usability, computational class, other features), pragmatic usages, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The requirements for the first part of the project presentation are as fallows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimum 3 ideas/concepts regarding the project design (including the sketches, wireframes, storyboards and, optionally, prototypes), plus the intermediary stages of the project development. Also, the team should provide the documentation – as Scholarly HTML – regarding interaction design patterns used in the wireframes/prototypes.</li>

                <li>Minimum 3 real examples concerning the QOC method. These examples could also give the motivation for choosing a certain idea/concept.</li>

                <li>The 4 mandatory HTML5 persona documents, for various personas interacting to the system.</li>

                <li>The project identity and the most significant details regarding the branding process.</li>
            </ul>
