            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                EsoX (Esoteric Language User Experience), is a project that is meant to imagine various user experiences regarding multiple ways of 
                interaction with an esoteric programming language, plus activities of  (e.g., learning, programming, translating into a general purpose 
                language, research,...) and related tools like interpreters, compilers, development environments, notable applications, and others. 
                The developed application will also recommend other (esoteric) programming languages according to user preferences, language categories 
                (paradigm, usability, computational class, other features), pragmatic usages, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The requirements for the first part of the project presentation are as fallows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimum 3 ideas/concepts regarding the project design (including the sketches, wireframes, storyboards and, optionally, prototypes), plus the intermediary stages of the project development. Also, the team should provide the documentation – as Scholarly HTML – regarding interaction design patterns used in the wireframes/prototypes.</li>

                <li>Minimum 3 real examples concerning the QOC method. These examples could also give the motivation for choosing a certain idea/concept.</li>

                <li>The 4 mandatory HTML5 persona documents, for various personas interacting to the system.</li>

                <li>The project identity and the most significant details regarding the branding process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Given the short but wide description there is a lot of room to maneuver so first thing we should narrow down the requirmeents to something that can 
                be managed.
            </p>

                To summarize the content of the image:  Esox mission is to offer new ways of interaction in order to learn programming or to program. This will be done
                by creating new tools or enhancing existing ones and by exploring diffrent "cultures" of giving introduction to machines.

            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <p>
                In this section will take a look at logo,  color scheme, text font-family and font-size (with scaling).

                Esoteric languages, are language that have to real use for most of humanity. They are made for fun in order to prove a point or to explore new concepts, but
                most of the time they are made just because. If we are to look however at the vast majority they are made for fun. As such the logo incorporates a emoji >_ 
                plus a slice of a lemon. The use of <strong>>_</strong> will also creat a link to the command line icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The slice of lemon is a throwback at the logo from <a href="https://esolangs.org/" itemprop="url">Esolang</a>.

                Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.

                For titles we picked Audiowide.

                        <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                        <p>Every day Stefan interacts with code, through IDE's or white boards or pen and paper. He has already established a process of
                            writing each feature he will deliver for the customers. Each time he has a small session of looking up in the existing code,
                            he says this is a must in order to understand the current state and logic of the code, where he wants, needs, to implement the 
                            new functionality. After that he will write a small flow diagram to check what components are need it and how the "data" flows.
                            Then he writes the code and after all is done he tests. 
                        </p>
                        <p>All that process dose not guarantee success but, Stefan says, it increases the chances of not having bugs in the code. If there are bugs
                            he will have to manualy check each state of code to see what happens (most of the times this is done mentally).
                        </p>
                        <p>He enjoys trying to write in different paradigmes, if the code is more data diven he will write it functionaly, if the functionality is simple
                            and the code needs to be delivered fast or is a prototype most of the time procedural will be the way to go. To add structure to data OOP is 
                            the way to go. He also likes to toy with should i use "composition or inheritance".
                        </p>
                        <p>Stefan said he has multiple accounts to sites like FrontendMasters and Brilliant or Egghead. He says that is the only way he can keep up with the 
                            changes in his field. At the same time he feels that most of the changes that come are just "more of the same with small nuances".

                        <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                        <p>A day in Iulia life is like a sprint with obstacles, a sprint within a maraton (1 year cycle) in which she has to deliver the condensed curriculum
                        while keeping the students intrested and answering all the question that are throw her way. Her students are very different in the way they understand 
                        the content so it's always challenging  to try and fit the content such that everyone understands.</p>
                        <p>Over the years she has found out that having more then one way to solve a problem and to represent it is the best way to go in teaching it to the kids.
                            For example in order to solve recursion they use a state table where each state of the recursion is marked and removed once the cycle is done. Or for
                            representing the swapping between 2 values they use actual objects like 3 cans and so own.
                        </p>
                        <p>She says she always looks to teach the students to experimet, "they need to have a flexible and agile mind and I have to come up with ways to help them".
                            In previous years she added, even if it's not in the curriculum C# and F# and they proved to be really fun and intriguing for the students and herself.
                            "The fact that they were able to visualise what they build. Not just some text on the screen but buttons and icons and such made the students really happy".
                            And the intresting part is that Iulia didn't had any prior knowlged of C# or F# but she did it for her students.
                        </p>
                        <p>Even if C# and F# had some good results they are close to C languages and now she hopes she can find something different to continue her experiment.</p>

                        <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
                        <p>Bogdan day starts usualy by reading his email, and answering to most urgent issues. Then he check with the project owner to see if the priorities are still the same. He then
                            moves on to his assigned tasks. To solve this he consults with the business analyst, in order to have a good grasp on the subject, "this helps me to make design decisions
                            that will help further down the line". On his desk you can find 2 books, one is Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software and Introduction to Algorithms (MIT Press).
                            He said he read them multiple times over the time of his career and it always helped him when he head to solve a though problem.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As my career progressed I've always tryed to help my peers to better understand how to structure the code in a natural way. "For me this always came easy, and so I want to share
                            my knowlged in the hopes that it will help my peers write better code, and in doing so having a better product". When he was younger Bogdan experimented with multiple paradigmes of
                            writing code, but as his senior, back then, advised him," I came to see that modeling the world should be in a 1 to 1 relation with the code it's only natural that we think in objects".
                            Paradigmes like Functional programming or Procedural or Logic are not natural, in his opinion, "They are intresting and a real brain workout but they don't solve with grace real world problems".
                        </p>
                        <p> As a professional Bogdan alawyas tries to stay on top of things so he reads about the advances in industry, any new book or accredited (form well established entities) workshop is wellcome. "I have 
                            to keep up with the changes in order to better solve the tasks that come my way. It is funny how ever how hard is to find something trully new - the older I get the harder is to not find patterns when
                            a new 'technology', somehow I can see the shorcomes almost immediately. I'm not going to say OOP is purfect but it's the best thing we have at the moment that is why I'm still looking".

                        <p>Iulia is a student at High School Grigore Moisil, as such her schedule is from 8 to 13 each day, 5 days a week. She enjoys the practical side
                            of things, she likes anything that has to do with actual real life experimentation. In her own words "if it's visual then I can reason about it".
                        </p>
                        <p>One of the best places, she says, is the High School lab of Informatics. Her teacher has an unusal way of teaching the curriculum, he uses real life objects,
                            like small cubs of different sizes and colors and applys most of the algorithms. Most of the curriculum materials will be created by the students, and that 
                            is the part Iulia likes the most. "It's the fact that you can see how and where each pice goes - you don't have to keep that in your head, we even creat shapes 
                            and arrows to draw logical diagrams".
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            She likes to apply the things she learns in the informatic class in other class also, it can help her to understand better the subject. It also helped her solve
                            problems she though she had no idead how to solve, because it gave her courage to try new ways of solving the issue without thinking that she "might fail". "It is
                            really hard to explain the feeling of joy when you solve a problem that you had no idea how to approach initially".
