            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                EsoX (Esoteric Language User Experience), is a project that is meant to imagine various user experiences regarding multiple ways of 
                interaction with an esoteric programming language, plus activities of  (e.g., learning, programming, translating into a general purpose 
                language, research,...) and related tools like interpreters, compilers, development environments, notable applications, and others. 
                The developed application will also recommend other (esoteric) programming languages according to user preferences, language categories 
                (paradigm, usability, computational class, other features), pragmatic usages, etc. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The requirements for the first part of the project presentation are as fallows:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimum 3 ideas/concepts regarding the project design (including the sketches, wireframes, storyboards and, optionally, prototypes), plus the intermediary stages of the project development. Also, the team should provide the documentation – as Scholarly HTML – regarding interaction design patterns used in the wireframes/prototypes.</li>

                <li>Minimum 3 real examples concerning the QOC method. These examples could also give the motivation for choosing a certain idea/concept.</li>

                <li>The 4 mandatory HTML5 persona documents, for various personas interacting to the system.</li>

                <li>The project identity and the most significant details regarding the branding process.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Given the short but wide description there is a lot of room to maneuver so first thing we should narrow down the requirmeents to something that can 
                be managed.
            </p>

                To summarize the content of the image:  Esox mission is to offer new ways of interaction in order to learn programming or to program. This will be done
                by creating new tools or enhancing existing ones and by exploring diffrent "cultures" of giving introduction to machines.

            <h2>Branding</h2>
            <p>
                In this section will take a look at logo,  color scheme, text font-family and font-size (with scaling).
            </p>
            <img alt="Creation of Logo">
            <p>
                Esoteric languages, are language that have to real use for most of humanity. They are made for fun in order to prove a point or to explore new concepts, but
                most of the time they are made just because. If we are to look however at the vast majority they are made for fun. As such the logo incorporates a emoji >_ 
                plus a slice of a lemon. The use of <strong>>_</strong> will also creat a link to the command line icon.
            </p>
            <p>
                The slice of lemon is a throwback at the logo from <a href="https://esolangs.org/" itemprop="url">Esolang</a>.

                Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere, for the sky was a dead black, and the stars had ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. Looking down into the dark gulf below, I could see a ruddy light streaming through a rift in the clouds.

            <p>
                For titles we picked Audiowide.
